# Lazaza React Assessment

This repository holds the boilerplate for a Trivia Quiz Game application.

Your goal is to write React code that delivers the product described in the ticket below. You should write code that you would feel comfortable submitting for code review and deploying to production.

**Please spend no more than two hours on this project.**

## Ticket LC-5678

This application currently fetches from a publically available api hosted at `https://opentdb.com/`, which serves trivia questions. You can see them logged in your browser console. However, that's nearly all it does - your task is to finish building this Trivia Game Application.

### Acceptance Criteria

A user should be able to:

- See instructions for how to play
- Start a fresh trivia game
- Select:
  - a category of questions
  - number of questions
  - any other configuration you see fit
- See their score and how many questions are remaining
- Start a new game at the end of their current game

Bonus: Feel free to show off your CSS skills to make the app attractive, dynamic and user-friendly.

### Out of Scope

- User Accounts / Auth
- Persistance
- Multi-Player Games
